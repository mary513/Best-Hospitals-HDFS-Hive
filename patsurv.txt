Patient surveys (see readme)
I used file=" HCAHPS – Hospital" as opposed to " hvbp_hcahps_05_28_2015". 
Though it might seem obvious to use the former, need to explore all patient survey-related data.

I could not find much documentation the latter.

The measurements were similar, but afterlooking at a few examples for pain managment, there seemed to be no correlationbetween the two tables (see README FOR BETTER images)

Criteria:
Number of Completed Surveys = 300 or more
Survey Response Rate Percent Footnote = blank
Hospital must be in large hospital Reference table

===>>>Results will show that highest scored surveys are for smallest hospitals, but these were not in my qualifying criteria for top hospiatals 

===>>>Without applying any Emergency room volume criteria, the data shows that Top 100 surveyed hosptials all are SMALL or SIZE NOT AVAIL

Find intersection between 2 tables:

Provider= 390203, Doylestown Hospital, PA is the only hospital in the top 10 providers that is among the to 100 Patient surveys.
