Query measures that are the 'most widely reported' (sort descending)
Examine these measures against reference table from Hospital.CSV documentation to understand the nature of the measure:
1)	measure should be based on 100% scale with higher = better 
a.	e.g. exclude measures such as "PC_01, percent of newborn deliveries scheduled too early"
2)	exclude measures based on total minutes (but should examine if more time for project)

===>>	Decision point: After exploring the data, measures after the 15th "most widely reported" measure (that met above 3 criteria) drastically cut the result set, due mostly to sample size requirement of >100. This would unfairly disqualify high-volume, highly-rated hospitals.
===>>	Example of a data analysis dilemma where we want to use the most robust set of qualifying criteria but not over-specify the criteria

Thus Top 15 measures were chosen

Other criteria to qualify as Top Hospital:
1)	Emergency Department Volume should be significant 
	a) Exclude low volumne (equates to less than 50 people a day)
b.	exclude volume not available
2)	Scores should not have a footnote(as all footnotes are disclaimers that compromise the data sample)
3)	Score should not be null

Verify that at least a significant number of hospitals meet above criteria (104 hospitals met this criteria)


Next consider 'poor care' tables : 
1) Complications 
2) Hospital Associated Infections 
3) Readmissions and Deaths
If top contenders meet national average or better than national average, this does not impact their status as high quality finalists. 
However, if top contenders have 'worse than national average' across more than 33% of their stated measures, they should be removed from high quality hospital finalists. We don't know if location, socio-economic environment, or just coincidental death rate have influenced these metrics'
Complications had 7 measures; >33% == more than 2 measures
Infections had 36 measures; >33% ==more than 12 measures
Readmissions/Deaths had 14 measures >33%= more than 4 measures
